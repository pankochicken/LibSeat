##Project Proposal:

Our proposal for the app development project is to create LibSeat. LibSeat’s main purpose is to display available tables and seats at Cal Poly’s Robert E. Kennedy Library in an easy and convenient manner for the end user. The app will simplify the struggle among students to find an empty table by showing a map with the approximate location of that table.  


The application will allow for three functions: 

For the user to check-in with a table by scanning a QR code at that table
To query which tables on each floor have been taken by other users of LibSeat in the library. Users will be able to filter results by floor and by number of available seats at a particular table.
For the user to manually check-out when leaving a table, or to automatically check the user out if certain conditions are met. Example conditions of this are: 
The user does not re-confirm their “check-in” after the duration times out (initial check-in duration set to 2 hours)
The user leaves the location of the library, with the possible intention of reserving a table before attending class
The user forgets to check-out from their table

## Additional Thoughts:

Because of the risk of an initial low adoption rate of the application, LibSeat can initially be used as a tool to inform the user which tables are currently not available, instead of the ideal purpose to inform users which tables are available. This implies that seats displayed in the application will have two states: (1) taken by another LibSeat user, or (2) available OR possibly available, depending on whether or not an individual occupying a table is using LibSeat.
